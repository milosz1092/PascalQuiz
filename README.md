## Beginning of my journey with programming.

Between 2008 and 2012 I've attended a technical school with an IT profile. It was there that I acquired my first practical programming skills. During the semesters, besides of C++, PHP and JavaScript, I had a pleasure of contact with old-fashioned Pascal programming language. It was really cool to write my first application using Turbo Pascal code editor running within command line.

### Pascal Quiz
* :open_file_folder: reading questions from file
* :grey_question: randomization of asking order
* usage of graphical :pencil2: and speaker :sound: interfaces
* :smile_cat: [description that I wrote then](https://github.com/milosz1092/PascalQuiz/blob/master/infor.txt)

After obtaining the appropriate number of points, the program displayed congratulations and played the melody with the loudspeaker installed on the motherboard.
